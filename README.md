## âš¡ About Me

Iâ€™m a **Frontend Engineer** specialising in **React, Next.js, and TypeScript**, helping ecommerce and SaaS companies build **fast, scalable, conversion-optimised applications**.

Over the past 8+ years, Iâ€™ve worked on large-scale platforms (including **EE.co.uk** and **CEF.co.uk**) where I delivered high-performance frontends, optimised Core Web Vitals, and built reusable component libraries.

Alongside my frontend work, Iâ€™m actively learning systems programming in **Rust** and contributing to **distributed database** projects.
